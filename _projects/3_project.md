The task of paraphrase identification, which involves determining whether two text segments convey the same meaning, is fundamental to natural language understanding and plays a crucial role in applications like machine translation, question answering, and plagiarism detection. Over the years, researchers have developed a wide range of datasets to facilitate advancements in this field, from manually curated collections to automatically generated ones, each addressing different aspects of linguistic variation. Deep learning methods, with their capacity to model complex relationships and semantic nuances, have revolutionized this domain by enabling more accurate and scalable solutions.

This review focuses on exploring the diverse datasets and deep learning techniques used for paraphrase identification. It examines how various datasets, such as Quora Question Pairs, Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus, and others, have shaped the evolution of the field. Additionally, it highlights recent deep learning architectures, including transformer-based models like BERT and attention mechanisms, which have significantly improved performance by capturing fine-grained semantic relationships. By analyzing these datasets and methods, this review provides insights into current trends, challenges, and future directions for developing robust paraphrase identification systems.
